# pigLatinChallenge
English to Piglatin translator. I downloaded SoloLearn on my phone and was presented with the challenge to make an english to piglatin translator. This is what I came up with. 

This is actually my first time writing code without a "code along" type setting (video or book). 

Original prompt:
    Pig Latin
    
    Pig Latin is an argot ("secret" language) in which words in English are altered to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. 

    You convert a word to pig latin by transferring the initial consonant or consonant cluster of the word to the end of the word with -ay appended to the end. If the word starts with a vowel (including y), append -yay to the end. For example, "pig" would become igpay (taking the 'p' and 'ay' to create a suffix).

    Examples:

        Input: say
        Output: aysay

        Input: english
        Output: englishyay

        Input: smile
        Output: ilesmay

    Write a program that translates the user input (an English word) to Pig Latin.
